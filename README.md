- 1337AGENT: A Knowledge-Based Chatbot Using LLaMA 2 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Project Description:

- The 1337AGENT is an AI-powered question-answering chatbot designed specifically to assist students with queries related to school rules, facilities, and schedules. Built on top of LLaMA 2, a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), this chatbot leverages state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of its responses by integrating external knowledge bases into the LLM's responses.

By loading specific school-related documents, the chatbot can answer real-time questions, such as dining hours, transportation schedules, and facility usage rules. The system is highly optimized for textual data, relying on document embeddings and natural language understanding to provide context-aware and precise responses.
